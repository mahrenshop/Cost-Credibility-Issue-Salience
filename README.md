# Cost-Credibility-Issue-Salience

Why don’t voters punish corruption in elections under optimal informational conditions?
Retrospective voting models argue that informational deficits distort a perfect principal-
agent relationship between voters and elected officials. However, even if information about
corrupt politicians is existent and credible, retrospective punishment of corruption is often
non-existent. I apply a different theoretical perspective to corruption voting by combining
prospective cost evaluations with the relative issue-salience in a formal model. I thus hy-
pothesize that voters do not punish corruption because corruption is less salient to voters
than other issues such as prosperity and security. I argue that this is because voters are
not willing to tolerate the costs associated with fighting corruption if other issues are more
salient – especially when anti-corruption policy promises are non-credible. I isolate relative-
issue salience as the causal mechanism linking anticipated costs and promise credibility of
the promise to vote choice in two steps. First, I will conduct a survey experiment treating
U.S. subjects with vignettes on costs and credibility of policy proposals and compare the
relative issue-salience of corruption, prosperity and security. Second, I will employ a con-
joint experiment where U.S. voters choose between two candidates promising policies with
randomly varying levels of policy issue, costs, and credibility.
